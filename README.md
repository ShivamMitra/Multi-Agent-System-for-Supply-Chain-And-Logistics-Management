# Multi Agent System for Supply Chain And Logistics Management

A prototype project that models and simulates a supply-chain & logistics management system using a multi-agent architecture. Each “agent” represents a distinct entity in the supply chain (e.g., supplier, manufacturer, distributor, transporter) that interacts, negotiates, plans and executes to achieve collective and individual goals.

## About the Project
Supply-chain and logistics operations are inherently distributed and dynamic, with multiple stakeholders making decisions under uncertainty. A multi-agent system (MAS) approach brings advantages such as autonomy of components, negotiation, coordination, and emergent behavior in complex systems.  
This project applies those ideas: each agent acts in its role, communicates, reacts to disruptions (e.g., demand spikes, delays, capacity constraints) and together the system demonstrates how coordination (or lack thereof) can impact metrics like cost, lead time, inventory, service level.

## Objectives & Motivation
- Model key supply chain stages (supplier → manufacturer → distributor → retailer/logistics) as interacting agents  
- Demonstrate decision-making, negotiation and coordination among agents under realistic constraints  
- Show how agents respond to disruptions (e.g., unexpected demand, transport delay) and how system performance varies  
- Provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different supply chain/topology settings  
- Offer a learning tool for supply-chain students or practitioners to experiment with MAS concepts in logistics  

## Key Features
- Agent classes for major supply-chain roles (supplier, manufacturer, transporter/distributor, retailer)  
- Negotiation or communication protocols between agents (order requests, transport booking, inventory adjustments)  
- Simulation loop of time periods: demand arrival, production, inventory movement, shipping, delay handling  
- Performance metrics collection: inventory levels, backlog, cost, service-level, transport utilization  
- Configurable scenarios: number of tiers, agent parameters, disruption events  
- Logging and visualization (if implemented) of agent interactions and system metrics  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (>=3.7 recommended)  
- Standard libraries for simulation, e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, (optional) `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for charts  
- (Optional) Multi-agent / messaging frameworks (if used)  
- A terminal or IDE for running scripts

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Multi-Agent-System-for-Supply-Chain-And-Logistics-Management.git
   cd Multi-Agent-System-for-Supply-Chain-And-Logistics-Management

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies (if a requirements.txt is provided):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Simulation
- Identify the main script (e.g., main.py, simulate.py, or similar).
- Configure scenario parameters (for example, number of agents, demand pattern, disruption probability) either via a config file or command-line arguments.
- Run the simulation:
  ```bash
  python simulate.py
- Observe the output: logs of agent actions, summary metrics, optional visualizations of performance.

## System Architecture
- Agent Layer: Each agent instance runs its logic: receives messages/requests, computes decisions (orders, shipments, inventory adjustments), sends messages.
- Communication / Coordination: Agents exchange structured messages (e.g., order request, confirmation, delay alert). Possibly a mediator or direct peer-to-peer messaging.
- Simulation Engine: Advances time steps, triggers demand events, routes shipments, applies delays or disruptions, updates agent states.
- Metrics & Evaluation: After simulation run, system collects key metrics (inventory costs, service levels, lead times) to evaluate performance under different strategies or disturbance levels.

## Usage & Scenarios
- Explore “what-if” scenarios: e.g., what happens if transport delays increase 50 %?
- Compare coordination strategies: e.g., centralized vs fully autonomous agents.
- Observe the “bullwhip effect” in supply chain: see how variability increases up the chain when agents act with limited communication or delay.
- Use as a basis for research or teaching: extend agents with learning algorithms (reinforcement learning), dynamic pricing, or real-world data feed.

## Extending / Future Work
- Integrate reinforcement-learning or game-theoretic strategies for agent decision-making
- Add real-time data feed (e.g., actual orders, shipments) and live dashboard
- Expand logistics network topology: multiple suppliers, multi-echelon, multi-regional distribution
- Incorporate stochastic elements: uncertain demand, variable transport times, quality defects
- Enable visualization: dynamic dashboards, network graphs, agent interaction logs
- Add negotiation/contract protocols: agents dynamically negotiate contracts, capacity sharing, pricing
- Experiment with hybrid coordination models (semi-centralised + agent autonomy) and compare efficiency.
